            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
                 for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such
                  as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
                 the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page 
                 semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and 
                other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML 
                provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text
                 such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are 
                 delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img tag and input tag
                  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as paragraph tag surround and provide 
                      information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers
                       do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects
                 the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
                 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the
                  CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language 
                used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as 
                HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, 
                colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more
                 flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable 
                 multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate 
                 .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well 
                 as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages
                  that share the file and its formatting.
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup 
                page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,
                 by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile 
                 devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on 
                 a mobile device.
                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme 
                to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
                 This cascading priority scheme is predictable
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 
                Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC
                 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">JavaScript</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is
                 a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
                  often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based 
                  object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables
                 interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for 
                 client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
                 It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard 
                 data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output
                  (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides
                   those APIs.
                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via
                 Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.
                Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard 
                libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
